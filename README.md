### Description:

For my final thesis at my faculty, I engineered this software solution that allows businesses in the floral industry to sell their products online. 
Technologies used:
* MongoDB - for database management.
* Express.JS + Node.JS - for developing the back end.
* React.JS - for developing the front end.

To bring something new to the table compared to already existing solutions on the market, I developed an AI-based product recommendation system.
The main player is the clusterization algorithm that classifies users in five different clusters, which are then used to recommend top products from the specific cluster a user belongs to.
However, since this AI component was intended for learning purposes only, the ML model is trained on a randomly generated dataset. For future use, it's important to note that the model should be trained on real data.
